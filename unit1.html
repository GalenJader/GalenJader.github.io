    <h1> Storm </h1>
    <h3> By: Tim Minchin </h3>
    <p>Inner north London top floor flat,<p>
    <ol type=1>
      <li>White walls,</li>
      <li>White carpet,</li> 
      <li>White cat,</li>
      <li>Rice-paper partitions,</li>
      <li>Modern art and ambitions,</li>
      <li>Bright bloke, has his own practice,</li>
      <li>His girlfriends an actress,</li>
    </ol>
    <p>And they're always great fun so to dinner we've come.</p>
    <p><em>The 5th guest</em> is an unknown, the hosts have just thrown us together for a favour. 'Cause this girl's just arrived from Australia, and she's moved to North London, and she's the sister of someone or has some connection. 
    <br> As we make introductions I am <strong>struck</strong> by her beauty, she is</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Irrefutably fair</li>
      <li>With dark eyes</li>
      <li>and dark hair</li>
    </ul>
